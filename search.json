Specifically, you can:\n\nSet the legend position to “top”, “left” or “bottom”\nUse a large or multiline plot title\nUse a large or multiline plot caption\nUse facet_wrap with scales=\"free\" scales=\"free_x\" or scales=\"free_y\"\n\nYou can now also align the plot_title, axis_title_x, axis_title_y and plot_caption with respect to the panels. Set these to “left”, “right” & “center” for the horizontal flowing text. And “top”, “right” & “center” for the vertical flowing text.\nAlso, the size of the figure is exactly determined by the theme setting. For example, this:\ntheme(figure_size=(8, 6), dpi=100)\nwill create an 800px x 600px image.\nYou can create a subtitle using labs and style it using the plot_subtitle parameter to theme.\n```py theme(plot_subtitle=element_text(size=8))\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\nggplot object gained a new method save_helper. It gives you access to the matplotlib figure that will be saved to file.\nWhen plotting with an ipython interactive backend (e.g. in a jupyter notebook). The default image output is retina. You do not need to run this command.\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = \"retina\"\nPlotnine still respects any values set the user.\nIn an interactive setting, after drawing an image. The size of the figure (in pixels) is printed e.g. &lt;Figure Size: (640 x 480)&gt;. Previously, something like &lt;ggplot: (336175301)&gt; was printed.\n\n\n\nAPI Changes\n\n__add__ and __iadd__ now accept the same types of objects. In this change __iadd__ has gained the ability to accept a list of objects.\ndraw no longer accepts the argument return_ggplot and the return value is always a matplolib figure.\nThemeables strip_margin, strip_margin_x and strip_margin_y) have been renamed to strip_align, strip_align_x strip_align_y repectively.\nsubplots_adjust has been deprecated. You no longer need to use theme(subplots_adjust={\"right\": 0.85}) and the like to make space for the legend or text around the panels. In the future, this will through an error.\nChanged default font-family (san-serif) from DejaVu Sans to Helvetica.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFixed bug where a discrete position scale failed when mapping an empty variable. (#647)\nFixed bug where facet_grid with a datetime column run into an exception. (#629)\nFixed bug where geom_violin with facetting and \"scales = free\" did not work. (#655)\nFixed bug in position_dodge2 to work with preserve=\"single\" for geom_rect and any other geoms that accept a min-max range along the x-axis.\nFixed legend for geom_point to accurately display transparent fill colors that have been manually set. (#665)\nFix issue where infinite limits for the x or y scales lead to an exception. (#664)\nFixed geom_text and geom_label when used with string formatting so that missing values are removed. (#651)"

(#604)\nFixed bug stat_density_2d which had been broken by Matplotlib 1.6.0. (#619)\nFixed geom_text when using adjust_text for the arrows to have the same color as the text.\n\n\n\nNew Features\n\ngeom_ribbon acquired new parameter where which can be used shade withing given limits .\nAdded support for objects with a to_pandas method to convert them to a pandas dataframe. You can now pass in polars dataframes.\ngeom_ribbon acquired new parameter outline_type which controls how to stroke the boundaries of the shaded area. This parameter is also available to geom_area and geom_density. (#605)\n\n\n\nAPI Changes\n\nThe automatic groups generated by the system and depending on the aesthetic mappings now only depend those aesthetics that have scales. This is more strict than has been, should affect very few cases of code that has been written and it should be less suprising to the users.\ngeom_area and geom_density now default to showing only the upper outline/boundary of the area.

    "text": "v0.6.0\n(2019-08-21)\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nAPI Changes\n\nThe draw parameter of geom_map has been removed. Shapefiles should contain only one type of geometry and that is the geometry that is drawn.\nOrdinal (Ordered categorical) columns are now mapped to ordinal scales. This creates different plots.\nThe default mapping for the computed aesthetic size of stat_sum has changed to 'stat(n)'. This also changes the default plot for geom_count.\n\n\n\nNew Features\n\ngeom_text gained the adjust_text parameter, and can now repel text.\nAdded annotation_logticks.\nAdded geom_sina\nAdded scales for ordinal (ordered categorical) columns.\ngeom_step gained the option mid for the direction parameter. The steps are taken mid-way between adjacent x values.\nAdded annotation_stripes.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\nFixed bug where facetting would fail if done on a plot with annotation(s) and one of the facetting columns was also a variable in the environment.\nFixed bug where coord_flip would not flip geoms created by geom_rug. (#216)\nFixed bug where plots with theme_xkcd cannot be saved twice. (#199)\nFixed bug that made it impossible to map to columns with the same name as a calculated columns of the stat. (#234)\nFixed bug in geom_smooth that made it difficult to use it with stats other than stat_smooth. (#242)\nFixed bug in position_dodge where by bar plot could get thinner when facetting and useing preserve = 'single'. (#224)\nFixed bug in coord_trans where if the transformation reversed the original limits, the order in which the data was laid out remained unchanged. (#253)\nFixed bug in stat_count where float weights were rounded and lead to a wrong plot. (#260)\nFixed bug where one could not use the British spelling colour to rename a color scale. (#264)\nFixed bug in lims, xlim, and ylim where datetime and timedelta limits resulted in an error.\nFixed bug where geom_rect could not be used with coord_trans. (#256)\nFixed bug where using free scales with facetting and flipping the coordinate axes could give unexpected results. (#286)\nFixed unwanted tick along the axis for versions of Matplotlib &gt;= 3.1.0.\nFixed geom_text not to error when using hjust and vjust. (#287)\nFixed bug where geom_abline geom_hline and geom_vline could give wrong results when used with coord_trans.\nFixed bug where layers with only infinite values would lead to an exception if they were the first layer encountered when choosing a scale.\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\nLegends are now plotted in a predictable order which dedends on how the plot is constructed.\nThe spokes drawn by geom_spoke can now have a fixed angle.\nAesthetics that share a scale (e.g. color and fill can have the same scale) get different guides if mapped to different columns.\nWhen the transform of a specialised (one that is not and identity scale) continuous scale is altered, the user is warned about a possible error in what they expect. (#254, #255)\nThe method_args parameter in stat_smooth can now differentiate between arguments for initialising and those for fitting the smoothing model.\nposition_nudge can now deal with more geoms e.g. geom_boxplot.\nThe limits parameter of scale_x_discrete and scale_y_discrete can now be a function.\nThe width of the boxplot can now be set irrespective of the stat.\nThe mid-point color of scale_color_distiller now matches that of the trainned data.\nThe way in which layers are created has been refactored to give packages that that extend plotnine more flexibility in manipulating the layers.\nYou can now specify one sided limits for coordinates. e.g. coord_cartesian(limits=(None, 10)).\nAll the themeables have been lifted into the definition of theme so they can be suggested autocomplete."

In the example below I’m using the default setting: raw count with after_stat('count').\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"count\"),  # specify each bin is a count\n        ),\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.50)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can normalise the raw count to 1 by using after_stat('ncount'):\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"ncount\"),  # normalise the count to 1\n        ),\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.50)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can display the density of points in a bin, (this is scaled to integrate to 1) by using after_stat('density'):\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"density\"),  # density\n        ),\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.50)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of bins can be shown, in the example below the bin=0.5 accounts for about ~55% of the data:\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"width*density\")),  # show proportion\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also display counts as percentages by using the percent_format() which requires the mizani.formatters library:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"width*density\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format())  # display labels as a percentage\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using stat you can use stat_bin defined within geom_histogram(), this is useful if you want to layer a few different plots in the one figure.\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\"))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5, alpha=0.5)\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.2, alpha=0.5, fill=\"green\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also flip the x-y coordinates:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"density\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + coord_flip()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can visualise counts by other variables using fill within aes():\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"count\"), fill=\"cut\"))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can visualise too-small-to-see bars by transforming the y-axis scaling by using scale_y_sqrt() square-root scale or scale_y_log10() for a log-scale (similarly use scale_x_sqrt() and scale_x_log10() to transform the x-axis).\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"count\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + scale_y_sqrt()  # square root scale\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"count\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + scale_y_log10()  # log scale\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the look of your plot:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"density\")))\n    + geom_histogram(\n        binwidth=0.5,\n        fill=\"green\",  # change the fill colour (one colour)\n        colour=\"pink\",  # change the outline\n        size=2,  # change the thickness of the outline\n        alpha=0.7,  # change the transparency\n    )\n    + theme_xkcd()  # play with themes (look/arrangement)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother change, this time changing the fill colours manually:\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"density\"),\n            fill=\"cut\",  # change the fill colour using another variable\n        ),\n    )\n    + scale_fill_manual(\n        values=[\"#000000\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\"]\n    )  # change the fill colour\n    + geom_histogram(\n        binwidth=0.5,\n        colour=\"#D55E00\",  # change the outline\n        size=1,  # change the thickness of the outline\n        alpha=0.7,  # change the transparency\n    )\n    + theme_bw()  # play with themes (look/arrangement)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen faceting histograms with scaled counts/densities, they are normalised by each facet, and not overall. Here’s an example of a facet wrap:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"ncount\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + facet_wrap(\"color\")  # facet wrap\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an example of a facet grid with the count normalised in each grid:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"ncount\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + facet_grid(\"cut\", \"color\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Histograms"

In the example below I’m using the default setting: raw count with after_stat('count').\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"count\"),  # specify each bin is a count\n        ),\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.50)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can normalise the raw count to 1 by using after_stat('ncount'):\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"ncount\"),  # normalise the count to 1\n        ),\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.50)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can display the density of points in a bin, (this is scaled to integrate to 1) by using after_stat('density'):\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"density\"),  # density\n        ),\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.50)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of bins can be shown, in the example below the bin=0.5 accounts for about ~55% of the data:\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"width*density\")),  # show proportion\n    )\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also display counts as percentages by using the percent_format() which requires the mizani.formatters library:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"width*density\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format())  # display labels as a percentage\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using stat you can use stat_bin defined within geom_histogram(), this is useful if you want to layer a few different plots in the one figure.\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\"))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5, alpha=0.5)\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.2, alpha=0.5, fill=\"green\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also flip the x-y coordinates:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"density\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + coord_flip()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can visualise counts by other variables using fill within aes():\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"count\"), fill=\"cut\"))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can visualise too-small-to-see bars by transforming the y-axis scaling by using scale_y_sqrt() square-root scale or scale_y_log10() for a log-scale (similarly use scale_x_sqrt() and scale_x_log10() to transform the x-axis).\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"count\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + scale_y_sqrt()  # square root scale\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"count\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + scale_y_log10()  # log scale\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the look of your plot:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"density\")))\n    + geom_histogram(\n        binwidth=0.5,\n        fill=\"green\",  # change the fill colour (one colour)\n        colour=\"pink\",  # change the outline\n        size=2,  # change the thickness of the outline\n        alpha=0.7,  # change the transparency\n    )\n    + theme_xkcd()  # play with themes (look/arrangement)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother change, this time changing the fill colours manually:\n\n(\n    ggplot(\n        diamonds,\n        aes(\n            x=\"carat\",\n            y=after_stat(\"density\"),\n            fill=\"cut\",  # change the fill colour using another variable\n        ),\n    )\n    + scale_fill_manual(\n        values=[\"#000000\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\"]\n    )  # change the fill colour\n    + geom_histogram(\n        binwidth=0.5,\n        colour=\"#D55E00\",  # change the outline\n        size=1,  # change the thickness of the outline\n        alpha=0.7,  # change the transparency\n    )\n    + theme_bw()  # play with themes (look/arrangement)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen faceting histograms with scaled counts/densities, they are normalised by each facet, and not overall. Here’s an example of a facet wrap:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"ncount\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + facet_wrap(\"color\")  # facet wrap\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an example of a facet grid with the count normalised in each grid:\n\n(\n    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=\"carat\", y=after_stat(\"ncount\")))\n    + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)\n    + facet_grid(\"cut\", \"color\")\n)"

The density curves have an area of 1 and have no information about the absolute frequency of the values along curve; only the relative frequencies. The count curve reveals the absolute frequencies. The scale of this count corresponds to the count calculated by the stat_bin for the histogram when the bins are 1 unit wide i.e. binwidth=1. The count * binwidth curve matches the scale of counts for the histogram for a give binwidth.\n\nbinwidth = 2  # The same for geom_density and geom_histogram\n\n(\n    ggplot(mpg, aes(x=\"cty\", color=\"drv\", fill=\"drv\"))\n    + geom_density(aes(y=after_stat(\"count*binwidth\")), alpha=0.1)\n    + geom_histogram(\n        aes(fill=\"drv\", y=after_stat(\"count\")),\n        binwidth=binwidth,\n        color=\"none\",\n        alpha=0.5,\n    )\n    # It is the histogram that gives us the meaningful y axis label\n    # i.e. 'count' and not 'count*2'\n    + labs(y=\"count\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShading a Region under a Density Curve\nExtending geom_density to create an effect of a shaded region\nCreate some data and plot the density\n\nn = 101\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"x\": np.arange(n)})\n\n(\n    ggplot(df, aes(\"x\"))\n    + geom_density()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to mark a region as special e.g. (40, 60), we can use vertical lines to annotate it.\n\nregion = (40, 60)\n\n(\n    ggplot(df, aes(\"x\"))\n    + geom_density()\n    + annotate(geom_vline, xintercept=region)  # new line\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it standout more we can highlight.

A single call to such a function can only plot lines with the same linestyle. However, if the plot we want has more than one line with different linestyles, we need to group the lines with the same linestyle and plot them as one unit. In this case, draw_group calls this function to do the plotting. For an example see .\n\n\nParameters\n\n\ndata : pd.DataFrame\n\nData to be plotted by this geom.

Note that each variable has different categorys.\nFirst we make a simple plot with all this information and see what to draw from it.\n\n(\n    ggplot(df, aes(x=\"variable\", y=\"value\", fill=\"category\"))\n    + geom_col()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the values along each variable add up to 100, but stacked together the difference within and without the groups is not clear. The solution is to dodge the bars.\n\n(\n    ggplot(df, aes(x=\"variable\", y=\"value\", fill=\"category\"))\n    + geom_col(stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\")  # modified\n)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is good, it gives us the plot we want but the legend is not great. Each variable has a different set of categorys, but the legend has them all clamped together. We cannot easily change the legend, but we can replicate it’s purpose by labelling the individual bars.\nTo do this, we create a geom_text with position_dodge(width=0.9) to match the ratio of the space taken up by each variable. If there was no spacing between the bars of different variables, we would have width=1.\nA minor quack, when text extends beyond the limits we have to manually make space or it would get clipped. Therefore we adjust the bottom y limits.\n\ndodge_text = position_dodge(width=0.9)  # new\n\n(\n    ggplot(df, aes(x=\"variable\", y=\"value\", fill=\"category\"))\n    + geom_col(stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\", show_legend=False)  # modified\n    + geom_text(\n        aes(y=-0.5, label=\"category\"),  # new\n        position=dodge_text,\n        color=\"gray\",\n        size=8,\n        angle=45,\n        va=\"top\",\n    )\n    + lims(y=(-5, 60))  # new\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould it look too crowded if we add value labels on top of the bars?\n\ndodge_text = position_dodge(width=0.9)\n\n(\n    ggplot(df, aes(x=\"variable\", y=\"value\", fill=\"category\"))\n    + geom_col(stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\", show_legend=False)\n    + geom_text(\n        aes(y=-0.5, label=\"category\"),\n        position=dodge_text,\n        color=\"gray\",\n        size=8,\n        angle=45,\n        va=\"top\",\n    )\n    + geom_text(\n        aes(label=\"value\"),  # new\n        position=dodge_text,\n        size=8,\n        va=\"bottom\",\n        format_string=\"{}%\",\n    )\n    + lims(y=(-5, 60))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks okay. The values line up with the categorys because we used the same dodge parameters. For the final polish, we remove the y-axis, clear out the panel and make the variable and category labels have the same color.\n\ndodge_text = position_dodge(width=0.9)\nccolor = \"#555555\"\n\n# Gallery Plot\n\n(\n    ggplot(df, aes(x=\"variable\", y=\"value\", fill=\"category\"))\n    + geom_col(stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\", show_legend=False)\n    + geom_text(\n        aes(y=-0.5, label=\"category\"),\n        position=dodge_text,\n        color=ccolor,\n        size=8,\n        angle=45,\n        va=\"top\",\n    )  # modified\n    + geom_text(\n        aes(label=\"value\"),\n        position=dodge_text,\n        size=8,\n        va=\"bottom\",\n        format_string=\"{}%\",\n    )\n    + lims(y=(-5, 60))\n    + theme(\n        panel_background=element_rect(fill=\"white\"),  # new\n        axis_title_y=element_blank(),\n        axis_line_x=element_line(color=\"black\"),\n        axis_line_y=element_blank(),\n        axis_text_y=element_blank(),\n        axis_text_x=element_text(color=ccolor),\n        axis_ticks_major_y=element_blank(),\n        panel_grid=element_blank(),\n        panel_border=element_blank(),\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: I saved a plot this example is based on a while ago and forgot/misplaced the link to the source.

The elements in the top have groups, and those in the bottom have no groups. We make separate dataframes for both – they have different alignments.\n\ntop = elements.query(\"group != -1\").copy()\nbottom = elements.query(\"group == -1\").copy()\n\nThe top table is nice and well behaving. The x location of the elements indicate the group and the y locations the period.\n\ntop[\"x\"] = top.group\ntop[\"y\"] = top.period\n\nThe bottom table has 2 rows, with the atomic number increasing to the right. We create an x based on the atomic number and add a horizontal shift. As the dataframe is ordered by atomic number, the operation is easier. The bottom elements are labelled with a “period”. We add a vertical shift to give us a good y location that gives the appearance of two tables.\n\nnrows = 2\nhshift = 3.5\nvshift = 3\nbottom[\"x\"] = np.tile(np.arange(len(bottom) // nrows), nrows) + hshift\nbottom[\"y\"] = bottom.period + vshift\n\nWe will be plotting using tiles and we want to have some space between the tiles. We have set the x and y locations above to take up a unit of space. To get a good effect, the tile dimensions should be less than 1.\n\ntile_width = 0.95\ntile_height = 0.95\n\nFirst peak\n\n(\n    ggplot(aes(\"x\", \"y\"))\n    + geom_tile(top, aes(width=tile_width, height=tile_height))\n    + geom_tile(bottom, aes(width=tile_width, height=tile_height))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table upside down. We could have been more careful when creating the y locations since the periods are drawn in descending order.

As we have two tables, that comes to 8 geom_text additions. When any geom is added to a ggplot object, behind the scenes a layer is created and added. We can create a group of layers that can be added to a ggplot object in one go using a list.\nWe use a function that accepts a dataframe, and returns a list of geoms.\n\ndef inner_text(data):\n    layers = [\n        geom_text(\n            data,\n            aes(label=\"atomic_number\"),\n            nudge_x=-0.40,\n            nudge_y=0.40,\n            ha=\"left\",\n            va=\"top\",\n            fontweight=\"normal\",\n            size=6,\n        ),\n        geom_text(data, aes(label=\"symbol\"), nudge_y=0.1, size=9),\n        geom_text(\n            data, aes(label=\"name\"), nudge_y=-0.125, fontweight=\"normal\", size=4.5\n        ),\n        geom_text(\n            data, aes(label=\"atomic mass\"), nudge_y=-0.3, fontweight=\"normal\", size=4.5\n        ),\n    ]\n    return layers\n\n\n(\n    ggplot(aes(\"x\", \"y\"))\n    + aes(fill=\"metal\")\n    + geom_tile(top, aes(width=tile_width, height=tile_height))\n    + geom_tile(bottom, aes(width=tile_width, height=tile_height))\n    + inner_text(top)  # new\n    + inner_text(bottom)  # new\n    + scale_y_reverse()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is crowded in there and the tiles do not have equal dimentions. Use the theme create a larger figure. coord_equal give us equal units along the axes, this makes the tiles square.\n\n(\n    ggplot(aes(\"x\", \"y\"))\n    + aes(fill=\"metal\")\n    + geom_tile(top, aes(width=tile_width, height=tile_height))\n    + geom_tile(bottom, aes(width=tile_width, height=tile_height))\n    + inner_text(top)\n    + inner_text(bottom)\n    + scale_y_reverse()\n    + coord_equal(expand=False)  # new\n    + theme(figure_size=(12, 6))  # new\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is has all the information we want, except one for complication. Elements Lu and Lr also belong in the bottom table. One way to show this duality is to have tiles with two colors split horizontally.\nThe colors are determined by the metal field, and we know the x and y locations.

First the contrast between the tiles and the text is not good for the lower passenger numbers. We use pd.cut to partition the number of passengers into two discrete groups.\n\nflights[\"p_group\"] = pd.cut(\n    flights[\"passengers\"], (0, 300, 1000), labels=(\"low\", \"high\")\n)\nflights.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nmonth\npassengers\np_group\n\n\n\n\n0\n1949\nJanuary\n112\nlow\n\n\n1\n1949\nFebruary\n118\nlow\n\n\n2\n1949\nMarch\n132\nlow\n\n\n3\n1949\nApril\n129\nlow\n\n\n4\n1949\nMay\n121\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n    ggplot(flights, aes(\"factor(year)\", \"month\", fill=\"passengers\"))\n    + geom_tile(aes(width=0.95, height=0.95))\n    + geom_text(aes(label=\"passengers\", color=\"p_group\"), size=9, show_legend=False)  # modified\n    + scale_color_manual([\"white\", \"black\"])  # new\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast tweaks, put January at the top and remove the axis ticks and plot background.\n\n# Gallery Plot\n\n(\n    ggplot(flights, aes(\"factor(year)\", \"month\", fill=\"passengers\"))\n    + geom_tile(aes(width=0.95, height=0.95))\n    + geom_text(aes(label=\"passengers\", color=\"p_group\"), size=9, show_legend=False)\n    + scale_color_manual([\"white\", \"black\"])  # new\n    + scale_y_discrete(limits=months[::-1])  # new\n    + theme(  # new\n        axis_ticks=element_blank(),\n        panel_background=element_rect(fill=\"white\"),\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get similar results if you replace\n + geom_tile(aes(width=.95, height=.95))\n + geom_text(aes(label='passengers', color='p_group'), size=9, show_legend=False)\nwith\n+ geom_label(aes(label='passengers', color='p_group'), size=9, show_legend=False)\nCredit: This example is a recreation of this seaborn example.\n\nSource: Periodic Table of Elements"

You can choose one these two commands:\n# Using pip\n$ pip install plotnine         # 1. should be sufficient for most\n$ pip install 'plotnine[all]'  # 2. includes extra/optional packages\n\n# Or using conda\n$ conda install -c conda-forge plotnine\nThe second pip command also installs packages that are required for some specific functionality that may not be frequently used. Those packages are:\n\nscikit-misc - For loess smoothing\nscikit-learn - For Gaussian process smoothing\n\n\n\nInstalling the Development Version\nTo do any development you have to clone the Plotnine source repository and install the package in development mode. These commands do all of that:\n$ git clone https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine.git\n$ cd plotnine\n$ pip install -e .\nIf you only want to use the latest development sources and do not care about having a cloned repository, e.g. if a bug you care about has been fixed but an official release has not come out yet, then use this command:\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine.git"

For example if we have monthly breaks over a handful of years we can mix date formats as follows; specify beginning of the year and every other month. Such tricks can be used reduce overcrowding.\n\nfrom datetime import date\n\n\ndef custom_date_format2(breaks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to format the date\n    \"\"\"\n    res = []\n    for x in breaks:\n        # First day of the year\n        if x.month == 1 and x.day == 1:\n            fmt = \"%Y\"\n        # Every other month\n        elif x.month % 2 != 0:\n            fmt = \"%b\"\n        else:\n            fmt = \"\"\n\n        res.append(date.strftime(x, fmt))\n\n    return res\n\n\n(\n    ggplot(economics.loc[40:60, :])  # modified\n    + geom_point(aes(\"date\", \"psavert\"))\n    + scale_x_datetime(\n        breaks=date_breaks(\"1 months\"), labels=custom_date_format2, minor_breaks=[]\n    )\n    + labs(y=\"personal saving rate\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe removed the labels but not the breaks, leaving behind dangling ticks for the skipped months.
