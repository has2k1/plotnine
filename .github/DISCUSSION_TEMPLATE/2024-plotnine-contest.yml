        Thank you for submitting to the [2024 Plotnine Contest](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-plotnine-contest/).
        The submission deadline is Friday, July 12, 2024 ([Anywhere on Earth](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth)).
        
        <details>
        <summary><b>What should my submission include?</b></summary>
        <br/>
        To produce your final plot, every submission must include all the code, data, and processing steps, at least minimally documented.
        <br/><br/>


        #### 1. Code

        <br>
        A link to the repository or script that fully reproduces your submission. Please include any data used to produce the plot.
        <br><br>

        #### 2. Plot

        <br>
        Include your plot. If your submission includes many plots (e.g. it’s a multipart tutorial or article that includes many plots), please also link away to the full article. 
        <br><br>

        #### 3. Documentation

        <br>
        Whether as code comments or via prose in something like a Quarto doc or Jupyter notebook, be sure to include an explanation of what you are doing, and how your code works. Comments may be minimal, but they should help a novice to plotnine understand how your code produces your final plot.

        <summary><b>How will submissions be judged?</b></summary>
        <br>


        Broadly, entries will be judged based on utility and beauty. 
        Is your plot easy to read and comprehend?
        Is it a technically impressive, well-documented example?
        Does it demonstrate novel, useful elements of plot design?
        Is it aesthetically pleasing?
        We recognize that some plots may excel in one of these categories, with some in another (and some in all).
        We promise that the evaluation will keep this in mind.
        <br><br>
        We also realize our judging criteria are subjective.
        Therefore, Hassan Kibirige, the creator of plotnine, along with a panel of visualization wizards will help review this year’s submissions.
