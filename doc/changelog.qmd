## v0.15.0

(not-yet-released)

### Enhancements

- Included datasets [](:attr:`~plotnine.data.mpg`), [](:attr:`~plotnine.data.msleep`) and
  [](:attr:`~plotnine.data.midwest`) no longer have any of their columns as categoricals.
  This matches the respective datasets in R. {{< issue 913 >}}

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in with the `legend_key_height` themeable where it wasn't applied.
  {{< issue 921 >}}

## v0.14.5
(2025-01-02)
[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14587381.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14587381)

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) with `adjust_text` so that the
  the arrows are drawn between layers with the text/label on top.

## v0.14.4
(2024-12-16)
[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14501317.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14501317)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) with `adjust_text` so that the
  the arrows are drawn at the same layer (zorder) as the text.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) with `adjust_text` for some
  cases where the text are placed outside the panels. {{< issue 899 >}}

- The default aesthetics and aesthetic parameters of geoms (and stats) are
  now transformed. So you can now set date values as aesthetic parameters.
  e.g.

  ```python
  geom_point(y=datetime(2024, 12, 11))
  ```

  if the `y` aesthetic is mapped to datetime column in another layer.

- Fixed bug for matplotlib>3.10 where the `axis_ticks_length` for the x-axis
  had no effect.

## v0.14.3
(2024-11-26)
[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14224336.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14224336)

### Enhancements

- Got rid of a logging information about the fontsize that is recorded for all
  plots that have a legend. ({{< issue 889 >}})

- When using [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) with `adjust_text`, some sensible
  default arrow properties will be applied.

- Changed the threshold number of keys for when the legend is split into multiple
  columns from 20 to 15. This only applies in the default case when the user does
  not set the number of rows or columns i.e. `guide_legend(nrow=None, ncol=None)`.
  ({{< issue 757 >}})

## v0.14.2
(2024-11-21)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14198479.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14198479)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bugs that affected [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_dotplot`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_sina`) where data with an index that
  did not include 0 led to a crash. ({{< issue 888 >}})

- Fixed `v0.14.0` regression that made [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_color_cmap_d`)
  unusable. ({{< issue 890 >}})

## v0.14.1
(2024-11-05)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14041304.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14041304)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix expansion of datetime and timedelta scales when using both the lower
  and upper addition constants.

- In quarto documents make the output `retina` even if the `fig-format` is
  `png`.

- Fixed bug where you could not save as pdf if also specifying the
  `aspect_ratio`. ({{< issue 885 >}})

## v0.14.0
(2024-10-28)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14006850.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14006850)

### API Changes

- You cannot call `print` on a ggplot object to show it. This was deprecated
  in `v0.13.0` and it has now been removed.
  Use [ggplot.show()](`plotnine.ggplot.show`)

- The color_space parameter of [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_color_hue`) now
  accepts the value `"hlsuv"` instead of `"husl"`. The meaning of has
  not changed, and `"husl"` is silently accepted.

- Themeables `axis_ticks_direction`, `axis_ticks_direction_x` and
  `axis_ticks_direction_y` have be deprecated. In their place, the direction
  of the ticks can be controlled by using +ve, -ve or complex values for
  the `axis_ticks_length`, `axis_ticks_length_major`, `axis_ticks_length_major_x`,
  `axis_ticks_length_major_y`, `axis_ticks_length_minor`, `axis_ticks_length_minor_x`,
  or `axis_ticks_length_minor_y`.

### Enhancements

- The `family`, `fontstyle` and `fontweight` parameters of
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) are now aesthetics ({{< issue 790 >}}).

- plotnine now responds to the `fig-width`, `fig-height` and `fig-format`
  settings in the meta section of a quarto document.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.ggtitle`) now accepts `title` and `subtitle` as
  keyword arguments. ({{<issue 804 >}})

- Gained the option [](:attr:`~plotnine.options.limitsize`) that makes
  it possible to display plots of any size.

  ```python
  from plotnine.options import set_option

  set_option("figure_format", False)
  ```

- For [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_boxplot`) when the outliers are made invisible
  by giving them no shape, now they do not affect the limits of the plot.
  ({{< issue 814 >}})

- Made it possile to map an aesthetic value to `None`. ({{< issue 791 >}})

- The signatures for the scale classes now list all the allowed parameters.


### New Features

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) has gained new aesthetics
  `fontvariant` and `fontstretch`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix layers 3 and above not to overlap the axis lines if there are any
  ({{< issue 798 >}}).

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_segment`) where the lineend
  parameter was ignored. ({{< issue 727 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_summary_bin`) to work with continuous `x`
  aesthetic when specifying the `binwidth` or `breaks`. ({{< issue 824 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.PlotnineAnimation`) not to draw a second legend
  at the bottom-left corner. ({{< issue 816 >}})

- Fixed bug where setting `theme(text=element_blank())` would raise and exception.

- Fixed `datetime` and `timedelta` scales so they can be expanded by
  adding constant `timedelta` values.

## v0.13.6
(2024-05-09)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11172701.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11172701)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_label`) to work with a `boxstyle` of any
  following `square`, `circle`, `darrow`, `larrow`, `rarrow`, `roundtooth`
  or `sawtooth`.({{< issue 779 >}})

### Enhancements

- Stopped spurious warnings of the form ``PlotnineWarning: Failed to apply
  `after_scale` modifications to the legend.`` when the `after_scale`
  mapping is for another aestetic.

- Added `width` and `height` as default aesthetics of [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_tile`).

## v0.13.5
(2024-04-26)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11075182.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11075182)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_smooth`) where you could not set the
  family when using a `glm`. ({{< issue 769 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.position_dodge2`) the widths of the
  dodged objects were mixed up. ({{< issue 772 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) to work better with
  [adjustText](https://pypi.org/project/adjustText/) `v1.0.0` and above.

- Fixed images generated in quarto so that they have the dimensions
  (taking the dpi into account) that are specified in theme. ({{< issue 773 >}})

### New

- Added themeable [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.svg_usefonts`).
  ({{< issue 756 >}})

### Enhancements

- Added _palmerpenguins_ dataset.

## v0.13.4
(2024-04-03)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10912461.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10912461)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed regression in v0.13.3 where setting some text elements `element_blank` led to an
  error. ({{< issue 764 >}})

## v0.13.3
(2024-03-27)
[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10887259.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10887259)


### Bug Fixes

- Fixed layout manager to make space for the `strip_text` when there is no
  `strip_background`. ({{< issue 760 >}})

- Made the default position of `guide_legend` text to be right. ({{< issue 761 >}})

- Fixed aligning (`ha` & `va`) of `plot_title`, `plot_subtitle`, `plot_caption`,
  `axis_title_x`, `axis_title_y` to work with float values in the range `[0, 1]`.

## v0.13.2

(2024-03-14)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10820452.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10820452)

### Enhancements

- Drawing the plot ensures that pandas Copy-on-Write is turned off. Plotnine
  is not yet compatible with Copy-on-Write so this prevents errors for users
  who have turned on the option.

## v0.13.1
(2024-03-06)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10790660.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10790660)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where a legend with blank title or text could result in a
  wrong justification.

- Fixed a bug where setting legend justification to a string i.e one of
  `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `center` had no effect.

## v0.13.0
(2024-02-20)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10684553.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10684553)

### API Changes

- Requires python >= 3.9

- Using the `print` or `repr` functions to draw and show the plot has
  been deprecated. Use [ggplot.show()](`plotnine.ggplot.show`).

- The name of the calculated aesthetic of
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_function`) changed from `y` to `fx`.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_ecdf`) has gained the `pad` parameter. The
  default is set to `True`, which pads the domain with `-inf` and `inf` so
  that the ECDF does not have discontinuities at the extremes. To get the
  behaviour, set `pad` to `False`. ({{< issue 725 >}})

- Removed the environment parameter from `ggplot`.

- When a ggplot object is the last in a jupyter cell, the output image will
  not be followed by string meta information about the figure/image.

  This will happen even if the backend is set to an interactive one.

  If you set the backend to an interactive one, use
  [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.show`) to draw the plot.

- The default horizontal alignment for the plot title is center if it
  there is no subtitle. When there is a subtitle, the default is to have
  both aligned to the left.

- Some parameters that control the look and feel of `guide_colorbar` and
  `guide_legend` have been removed. For their place, the `theme` parameter
  has been introduced and it gives better control of the look and feel.

- Themeables `legend_entry_spacing`, `legend_entry_spacing_x` and
  `legend_entry_spacing_y` have been renamed to `legend_key_spacing`,
  `legend_key_spacing_x` and `legend_key_spacing_y` respectively

- [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) now accepts two parameters,
  `rows` and `cols`, to specify the variables along the two dimensions of
  the panels.

  The previous way of using a single parameter will still work if it is a
  string. For cases where the value was a list, e.g.

  ```python
  facet_grid(facets=["col1", "col2"])
  ```

  can be rewritten as any one of;

  ```python
  facet_grid("col1", "col2")
  facet_grid(["col1"], ["col2"])
  facet_grid(rows="col1", cols="col2")
  facet_grid(rows=["col1"], cols=["col2"])
  ```

- The `facets` parameter in [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_wrap`) has
  also changed to a more straight forward specification for the column
  variables. It expects a single string or a list/tuple of strings.
  ({{< issue 545 >}})

  However, the R-style formula strings are still silently accepted.

### New

- Added symmetric logarithm transformation scales
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_x_symlog`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_y_symlog`)

- Gained themeables

  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.plot_margin_left`)
  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.plot_margin_right`)
  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.plot_margin_top`)
  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.plot_margin_bottom`)

  to set the plot margin on each side independently.

- Gained themeables

  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.axis_ticks_length_major_x`)
  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.axis_ticks_length_major_y`)
  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.axis_ticks_length_minor_x`)
  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.axis_ticks_length_minor_y`)

  to control the x & y axis ticks length.

- Gained themeables

  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.axis_ticks_pad_major_x`)
  - [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.axis_ticks_pad_minor_y`)

  to control the x & y tick padding.

- Some parameters in [](:class:`~plotnine.element_text`) can now
  accept lists/tuples to set the values on individual text objects.
  ({{< issue 724 >}})

- Gained the option [](:attr:`~plotnine.options.figure_format`) to set
  the format of the inline figures in an interactive session. e.g.

  ```python
  from plotnine.options import set_option

  set_option("figure_format", "svg")
  ```

  will output all subsequent figures in svg format.

- Improved support for customizing guides/legends.

  - You can now add a frame to the colobar
  - You can now apply themes to individual guides, e.g.

    ```py
    + guides(color=guide_colorbar(theme=theme_xkcd()))
    ```
    or

    ```py
    + guides(color=guide_legend(theme=theme_minimal())
    ```

  - You can now place legends at more than one position
    around the panels. e.g.

    ```py
    + guides(
        color=guide_colorbar(position="left"),
        fill=guide_legend(position="bottom"),
        size=guide_legend(position="bottom")
    )
    ```

    Puts the `fill` and `size` guides at the bottom, and the
    `color` guide on the left.

  - You can easily justify the legend along the four edges
    of the space around the panel area.

  - You can now place the legend inside the panels with easily
    control its location.

- The `space` parameter of [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) now
  responds to the values `free`, `free_x` and `free_y` to have panels
  whose relative width and/or height depends on the data range.
  ({{< issue 545 >}})

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed handling of minor breaks in
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scales.scale_continuous.scale_continuous`)
  to accept numpy arrays and when the scale has a transform, that the
  minor breaks are supplied in user space and not transform space. Just
  like the major breaks. ({{< issue 685 >}})

- Fixed theming of axis_ticks with the size parameter. ({{< issue 703 >}})

- Fixed space handling around `axis_label`, `axis_text` and `axis_ticks` when
  the ticks are turned off.

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_path`) where the lineend parameter
  was ignored. ({{< issue 727 >}})

- Fixed bug where `theme(legend_background=element_blank())`{.py} messed up
  the position of the legend, instead of only removing the background.

- Fixed using `facet_grid` with a column named `key`. ({{< issue 734 >}})

- Fixed using legend when using an identity scale and reordering the
  breaks. ({{< issue 735 >}})

- Fixed drawing the upper outline of `geom_ribbon`. ({{< issue 728 >}})

- Fixed issue where the gridlines overlap the panel border. ({{< issue 638 >}})

### Enhancements

- All `__all__` variables are explicitly assigned to help static typecheckers
  infer module attributes. ({{< issue 685 >}})

- You can now pickle the drawn matplotlib figures. ({{< issue 729 >}})

- The facet titles in the `strip_text` are now better aligned are appear more
  centered within the `strip_background`.


## v0.12.4
(2023-11-06)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2635624.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2635624)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed [](`~plotnine.position_dodge`) to work with
  to work for [](`~plotnine.geom_segment`).

- Fixed the `x` limits when plotting [](`~plotnine.geom_sina`).

- Fixed [](`~plotnine.stat_boxplot`) and
  [](`~plotnine.stat_ydensity`) when there is no `x` aesthetic.

### Enhancements
- Return group counts for [](`~plotnine.stat_summary`).

## v0.12.3
(2023-09-01)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8309962.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8309962)

### Enhancements

- Resolved Future Warnings from pandas-2.1.0

## v0.12.2
(2023-07-21)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8171350.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8171350)

- This is a maintenance release that prevents newer versions of
  mizani from breaking plotnine. This version depends on `mizani<0.10.0`.

## v0.12.1
(2023-05-09)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7919297.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7919297)

### New Features

- A layout manager. Now you do not have to adjust spacing parameters
  to prevent objects around the panels from overlapping.
  Specifically, you can:

  1. Set the legend position to "top", "left" or "bottom"
  2. Use a large or multiline plot title
  3. Use a large or multiline plot caption
  4. Use [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_wrap`) with `scales="free"`{.py}
     `scales="free_x"`{.py} or `scales="free_y"`{.py}

  You can now also align the `plot_title`, `axis_title_x`, `axis_title_y`
  and `plot_caption` with respect to the panels. Set these to "left",
  "right" & "center" for the horizontal flowing text. And "top", "right"
  & "center" for the vertical flowing text.

  Also, the size of the figure is exactly determined by the theme setting.
  For example, this:

  ```py
  theme(figure_size=(8, 6), dpi=100)
  ```

  will create an `800px x 600px` image.

- You can create a `subtitle` using [](:class:`~plotnine.labs`) and
  style it using the `plot_subtitle` parameter to [](:class:`~plotnine.theme`).

  ```py
  theme(plot_subtitle=element_text(size=8))

### Enhancements

- [](:class:`~plotnine.ggplot`) object gained a new method
  [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.save_helper`). It gives you access to the
  matplotlib figure that will be saved to file.

- When plotting with an ipython interactive backend (e.g. in a
  jupyter notebook). The default image output is retina. You
  do not need to run this command.

  ```py
  %config InlineBackend.figure_format = "retina"
  ```

  Plotnine still respects any values set the user.

- In an interactive setting, after drawing an image. The size of the figure
  (in pixels) is printed e.g. `<Figure Size: (640 x 480)>`. Previously,
  something like `<ggplot: (336175301)>` was printed.

### API Changes

- [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.__add__`) and [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.__iadd__`)
  now accept the same types of objects. In this change
  [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.__iadd__`) has gained the ability to accept a
  list of objects.

- [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.draw`) no longer accepts the argument
  `return_ggplot` and the return value is always a matplolib figure.

- Themeables `strip_margin`, `strip_margin_x` and `strip_margin_y`) have been
  renamed to
  [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.strip_align`),
  [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.strip_align_x`)
  [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.strip_align_y`) respectively.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.subplots_adjust`) has been deprecated.
  You no longer need to use `theme(subplots_adjust={"right": 0.85})`{.py} and
  the like to make space for the legend or text around the panels.
  In the future, this will through an error.

- Changed default font-family (san-serif) from DejaVu Sans to Helvetica.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug where a discrete position scale failed when mapping
  an empty variable. ({{< issue 647 >}})

- Fixed bug where [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) with a datetime
  column run into an exception. ({{< issue 629 >}})

- Fixed bug where [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_violin`) with facetting
  and `"scales = free"` did not work. ({{< issue 655 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.position_dodge2`) to work with
  `preserve="single"` for [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_rect`) and any other
  geoms that accept a min-max range along the x-axis.

- Fixed legend for [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_point`) to accurately display
  transparent fill colors that have been manually set. ({{< issue 665 >}})

- Fix issue where infinite limits for the `x` or `y` scales lead to an
  exception. ({{< issue 664 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_label`) when used with string formatting so that
  missing values are removed. ({{< issue 651 >}})

## v0.10.1
(2022-09-10)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7124917.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7124917)

*This is a re-release of v0.10.0*.

In the previous release the project description fileformat changed
and not all references to it were corrected. PYPI read file that did
not exist, got no description. This release is fixes error.

## v0.10.0
(2022-09-10)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7124912.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7124912)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_bin_2d`) where bins whose edges
  are zero or negative would yield the wrong plot. ({{< issue 604 >}})

- Fixed bug [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_density_2d`) which had been broken
  by Matplotlib 1.6.0. ({{< issue 619 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) when using `adjust_text` for
  the arrows to have the same color as the text.

### New Features

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_ribbon`) acquired new parameter `where`
  which can be used shade within given limits .

- Added support for objects with a `to_pandas` method to convert them to
  a pandas dataframe. You can now pass in [polars](https://pola.rs) dataframes.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_ribbon`) acquired new parameter `outline_type`
  which controls how to stroke the boundaries of the shaded area. This parameter
  is also available to [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_area`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_density`). ({{< issue 605 >}})

### API Changes

- The automatic groups generated by the system and depending on the aesthetic
  mappings now only depend those aesthetics that have scales. This is more
  strict than has been, should affect very few cases of code that has been
  written and it should be less surprising to the users.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_area`) and [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_density`)
  now default to showing only the upper outline/boundary of the area.
  Use `outline_type="full"` for the old behaviour.

## v0.9.0
(2022-07-01)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7124918.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7124918)

### API Changes

- For the calls to `ggplot`, the order of the positional arguments is
  `(data, mapping)` and for calls `geoms` and `stats` the order
  is `(mapping, data)`. In practice, you can still provide one/two
  positional arguments in any order. However, the are a few cases
  where old code will breaks due to duplicate parameters.

### New Features

- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_pointdensity`), a 2D density plot
  that does not hide the distribution of the individual data points.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.position_dodge2`) gained the ability to reverse
  the order of the plotted groups. ({{< issue 515 >}})

- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.theme_tufte`), a theme that reduces the
  distractions around plot data.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.labs`) can now be used to create a `caption`.
  This caption can be styled using the `plot_caption` parameter to
  [](:class:`~plotnine.theme`).

  ```py
  theme(plot_caption=element_text(size=13))
  ```

- You can now align the `plot_title` horizontally to the left or right.

  ```py
  theme(plot_title=element_text(ha="left"))
  ```

  Before, the title was always centered.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_wrap`) where the `drop` parameter was
  ignored. ({{< issue 510 >}})

- Fixed issue with [](:class:`~plotnine.annotation_logticks`) where the
  wrong range was used for the x|y axis. ({{< issue 525 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_smooth`) where using a
  coordinate transformation without computing the standard error
  led to a crash. ({{< issue 526 >}})

- Fixed bug where you could not specific the cap/end of a dashed line
  when styling a plot with [](:class:`~plotnine.element_line`).

- Fixed legend for [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) so that the entries
  have the same stroke and points on the map. ({{< issue 534 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_histogram`) for some cases when it fails
  to automatically determine the number of bins. ({{< issue 543 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_wrap`) when mapping to lists/arrays/series
  so that the rows mapped this way are not mixed up. ({{< issue 548 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_bin_2d`) not to error for
  matplotlib >= 3.5.0 so that it does not throw a Numpy error.
  ({{< issue 567 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) to be able to draw Polygons
  with holes in them.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) to be able to draw MultiPolygons.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_x_discrete`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_x_discrete`) to work properly with `None`
  values. ({{< issue 523 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_point`) to respect not to use the `fill`
  mapping on unfilled shapes. ({{< issue 100 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.position_stack`) to work with scales that
  have non-linear transformations. e.g.
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_y_log10`). ({{< issue 580 >}})

- Fixed scales to work with limits passed as a function.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.axis_ticks`) so you can change
  the colour of the axis ticks. This was probably a regression due to changes
  in Matplotlib.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.panel_ontop`) so that if is set to
  `False`, then the data visualised below the grid-lines. ({{< issue 585 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_ribbon`), [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_area`)
  and [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_density`) to work with
  [](:class:`~plotnine.coord_flip`). ({{< issue 596 >}})

### Enhancements

- [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_summary`) now has a default summary
  function. ({{< issue 528 >}})

- [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_density`) now uses a fast computation path
  for gaussian densities with no weights. This was probably a regression.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) can now draw MultiPoints,
  MultiLineStrings and MultiPolygons.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) with `adjust_text` can now be used
  in more than one layer with good enough results.

### API Changes

- How you map to calculated aesthetics has changed. Use the
  [](:func:`~plotnine.after_stat`) function. The old
  methods `'stat(name)'` and `'..name..'` have been deprecated.

### New Features

- You can now map to aesthetics at three different stages. See
  [](:class:`~plotnine.aes`), [](:func:`~plotnine.after_stat`),
  [](:func:`~plotnine.after_scale`) and [](:class:`~plotnine.stage`).

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_violin`) gained the a new parameter `style`
  with which you can draw half violin (density curve on one side and flat
  on the other).

- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_raster`).

- `geoms` gained new parameter `raster` for the
  [](:class:`~plotnine.layer.layer`). You can use it to rasterize any layer
  when the resulting plot is of vector format e.g. `pdf`.

- Using the `space` parameter, [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`)
  gained the ability to have rows and columns of panels of different
  sizes.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where some plots with a colorbar would fail for specific
  themes. ({{< issue 424 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) to plot `MultiLineString` geom types.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) to allow any order of `mapping` and
  `data` positional arguments.

- Fixed bug were the plotted image may have ignored theming that relied on
  some Matplotlib rcParams. ({{< issue 451 >}})

- Fixed the `weight` aesthetic in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_boxplot`), previously
  ignored it is now recognised. ({{< issue 438 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.annotation_logticks`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.annotation_stripes`) to work without global data and
  aesthetics. ({{< issue 469 >}})

- Fix [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_shape_discrete`) when printing many unfilled shapes
  not to assign the same shapes to more than one group. ({{< issue 473 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_ellipse`) where the center of the ellipse
  assuming a multivariate t-distribution was incorrectly calculated. ({{< issue 493 >}})

- Fixed calculation of `ndensity` in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_bin`).
  ({{< issue 494 >}})


### Enhancements
- Manual scales now match the values of the breaks if the breaks are given.
  ({{< issue 445 >}})

- Using `print` to show a ggplot object will not show the hash
  (`<ggplot: ...>`) anymore. There is now a difference between
  `repr(p)` and `str(p)`. ({{< issue 453 >}})

- Added option to for the `base_family` of a theme, now you can set it
  once with and have it be applied to all themes. ({{< issue 436 >}})

  ```py
  from plotnine.options import set_option
  set_option('base_family', 'Comic Sans MS')
  ```

- You can now add `None` to a ggplot, doing so returns a copy of the
  the ggplot object. ({{< issue 474 >}})

- Better handling of multiline facet labels. ({{< issue 484 >}})

## v0.7.1
(2020-08-05)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3973626.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3973626)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where a plot has no data and the geoms have no data,
  but the mappings are valid. ({{< issue 404 >}})

- Fixed `preserve="single"` in [](:class:`~plotnine.position_dodge`)
  and [](:class:`~plotnine.position_dodge2`) to work for geoms that
  only have `x` aesthetic and not `xmin` and `xmax`
  e.g [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`).

- Fix regression in `v0.7.0` where plots with a colorbar
  would fail if using [](:class:`~plotnine.theme_matplotlib`).

## v0.7.0
(2020-06-05)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3878645.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3878645)


### API Changes

- Changed the default method of calculating bandwidth for all stats that
  use kernel density estimation. The affected stats are
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_density`),
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_ydensity`), and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_sina`). These stats can now work with groups
  that have a single unique value.

- Changed `scale_colour_continuous` to refer to the same
  scale as [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_color_continuous`).

- Changed [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_color_cmap`) so the parameter
  `cmap_name` refers to the name of the color palette and `name` refers
  to the name of the scale. ({{< issue 371 >}})

### New Features

- `aes` got an internal function `reorder` which
  makes it easy to change the ordering of a discrete variable according
  to some other variable/column.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_smooth`) can now use formulae for linear
  models.


### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where a wrong warning could be issued about changing the
  transform of a specialised scale. It mostly affected the *timedelta*
  scale.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_violin`) and other geoms when used
  with `position="dodge"` not to crash when if a layer has an empty
  group of data.

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_path`) for some cases when groups
  had less than 2 points. ({{< issue 319 >}})

- Fixed all stats that compute kernel density estimates to work when all
  the data points are the same. ({{< issue 317 >}})

- Fixed issue where setting the group to a string value i.e. `group="string"`
  outside `aes()` failed due to an error.

- Fixed issue where discrete position scales could not deal with fewer limits
  than those present in the data. ({{< issue 342 >}})

- Fixed issue with using custom tuple linetypes~ with
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_linetype_manual`). ({{< issue 352 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) to work with facets. ({{< issue 359 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.position_jitterdodge`) to work when `color` is
  used as an aesthetic. ({{< issue 372 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_qq`) to work with facets. ({{< issue 379 >}})

- Fixed skewed head in [](:class:`~plotnine.arrow`) when drawn on
  facetted plot. ({{< issue 388 >}})

- Fixed issue with [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_density`) where weights could
  not be used with a gaussian model. ({{< issue 392 >}})

- Fixed bug where [](:class:`~plotnine.guide_colorbar`) width and height
  could not be controlled by
  [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.legend_key_width`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.legend_key_height`). ({{< issue 360 >}})

### Enhancements

- You can now set the bandwidth parameter `bw` of
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_ydensity`).

- Parameters `ha` and `va` of [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) have been converted
  to aesthetics. You can now map to them. ({{< issue 325 >}})

- All themes (except `theme_matplotlib`) now do not show minor ticks. ({{< issue 348 >}})

## v0.6.0
(2019-08-21)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3373970.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3373970)

### API Changes

- The `draw` parameter of [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) has been removed.
  Shapefiles should contain only one type of geometry and that is the geometry
  that is drawn.

- Ordinal (Ordered categorical) columns are now mapped to ordinal scales. This
  creates different plots.

- The default mapping for the computed aesthetic *size* of
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_sum`) has changed to `'stat(n)'`. This also
  changes the default plot for [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_count`).

### New Features

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) gained the `adjust_text` parameter,
  and can now repel text.
- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.annotation_logticks`).
- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_sina`)
- Added scales for ordinal (ordered categorical) columns.
- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_step`) gained the option `mid` for the
  direction parameter. The steps are taken mid-way between adjacent x values.
- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.annotation_stripes`).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug where facetting would fail if done on a plot with annotation(s)
  and one of the facetting columns was also a variable in the environment.

- Fixed bug where [](:class:`~plotnine.coord_flip`) would not flip
  geoms created by [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_rug`). ({{< issue 216 >}})

- Fixed bug where plots with [](:class:`~plotnine.theme_xkcd`) cannot be
  saved twice. ({{< issue 199 >}})

- Fixed bug that made it impossible to map to columns with the same name as
  a calculated columns of the stat. ({{< issue 234 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_smooth`) that made it difficult
  to use it with stats other than [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_smooth`).
  ({{< issue 242 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.position_dodge`) where by bar plot
  could get thinner when facetting and using `preserve = 'single'`.
  ({{< issue 224 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.coord_trans`) where if the transformation
  reversed the original limits, the order in which the data was laid out remained
  unchanged. ({{< issue 253 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_count`) where `float` weights were
  rounded and lead to a wrong plot. ({{< issue 260 >}})

- Fixed bug where one could not use the British spelling `colour` to rename
  a color scale. ({{< issue 264 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.lims`), [](:class:`~plotnine.xlim`),
  and [](:class:`~plotnine.ylim`) where `datetime` and `timedelta` limits
  resulted in an error.

- Fixed bug where [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_rect`) could not be used with
  [](:class:`~plotnine.coord_trans`). ({{< issue 256 >}})

- Fixed bug where using free scales with facetting and flipping the coordinate
  axes could give unexpected results. ({{< issue 286 >}})

- Fixed unwanted tick along the axis for versions of Matplotlib >= 3.1.0.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) not to error when using `hjust`
  and `vjust`. ({{< issue 287 >}})

- Fixed bug where [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_abline`)
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_hline`) and [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_vline`)
  could give wrong results when used with [](:class:`~plotnine.coord_trans`).

- Fixed bug where layers with only infinite values would lead to an exception
  if they were the first layer encountered when choosing a scale.

### Enhancements

- Legends are now plotted in a predictable order which dedends on how the plot
  is constructed.

- The spokes drawn by [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_spoke`) can now have a fixed
  angle.

- Aesthetics that share a scale (e.g. color and fill can have the same scale) get
  different guides if mapped to different columns.

- When the transform of a specialised (one that is not and identity scale) continuous
  scale is altered, the user is warned about a possible error in what they expect.
  ({{< issue 254 >}}, {{< issue 255 >}})

- The `method_args` parameter in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_smooth`) can now
  differentiate between arguments for initialising and those for fitting the
  smoothing model.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.position_nudge`) can now deal with more geoms e.g.
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_boxplot`).

- The `limits` parameter of [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_x_discrete`) and
    [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_y_discrete`) can now be a function.

- The `width` of the boxplot can now be set irrespective of the stat.

- The mid-point color of [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_color_distiller`) now
  matches that of the trained data.

- The way in which layers are created has been refactored to give packages that
  that extend plotnine more flexibility in manipulating the layers.

- You can now specify one sided limits for coordinates. e.g.
  `coord_cartesian(limits=(None, 10))`{.py}.

- All the themeables have been lifted into the definition of
  [](:class:`~plotnine.theme`) so they can be suggested autocomplete.

## v0.5.1
(2018-10-17)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1464803.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1464803)

### Bug Fixes

- Changed the dependency for mizani to `v0.5.2`. This fixes an issue
  where facetting may create plots with missing items. ({{< issue 210 >}})

## v0.5.0
(2018-10-16)

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1464204.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1464204)

### API Changes

- Plotnine 0.5.0 only supports Python 3.5 and higher
- geopandas has been removed as a requirement for installation. Users of
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_map`) will have to install it separately.
  ({{< issue 178 >}})

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where with the `subplots_adjust` themeable could not be used to
  set the `wspace` and `hspace` Matplotlib subplot parameters. ({{< issue 185 >}})

- Fixed in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_bin`) where setting custom limits for the
  scale leads to an error. ({{< issue 189 >}})

- Fixed issue interactive plots where the x & y coordinates of the mouse do not
  show. ({{< issue 187 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_abline`) where passing the mapping as
  a keyword parameter lead to a wrong plot. ({{< issue 196 >}})

- Fixed issue where `minor_breaks` for transformed scaled would have to be given
  in the transformed coordinates. Know they are given the data coordinates just
  like the major `breaks`.

### Enhancements

- For all geoms, with [](:class:`~plotnine.coord_cartesian`) `float('inf')`
  or `np.inf` are interpreted as the boundary of the plot panel.

- Discrete scales now show missing data (`None` and `nan`). This behaviour
  is controlled by the new `na_translate` option.

- The `minor_breaks` parameter for continuous scales can now be given as an
  integer. An integer is taken to control the number of minor breaks between
  any set of major breaks.

## v0.4.0
*2018-01-08*

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1325309.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1325309)

### API Changes

- Calculated aesthetics are accessed using the `plotnine.aes.stat`
  function. The old method (double dots `..name..`) still works.

- [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_qq`) calculates slightly different points
  for the theoretical quantiles.

- The `scales` (when set to *free*, *free_x* or *free_y*) parameter of
  [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) and [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_wrap`)
  assigns the same scale across the rows and columns.


### New Features

- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_qq_line`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_qq_line`), for lines through Q-Q plots.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where colorbars may chop off the colors at the limits
  of a scale.

- Fixed issue with creating fixed mappings to datetime and timedelta
  type values. ({{< issue 88 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_x_datetime`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_y_datetime`) to handle the intercepts
  along the axes. ({{< issue 97 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_bin`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_bin_2d`) to properly handle the
  `breaks` parameter when used with a transforming scale.

- Fixed issue with x and y scales where the `name` of the scale was
  ignored when determining the axis titles. Now, the `name` parameter
  is specified, it is used as the title. ({{< issue 105 >}})

- Fixed bug in discrete scales where a column could not be mapped
  to integer values. ({{< issue 108 >}})

- Make it possible to hide the legend with `theme(legend_position="none")`.
  ({{< issue 119 >}})

- Fixed issue in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_summary_bin`) where some input
  values gave an error. ({{< issue 123 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_ribbon`) to sort data before plotting.
  ({{< issue 127 >}})

- Fixed `IndexError` in [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) when row/column
  variable has 1 unique value. ({{< issue 129 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) when `scale="free"`,
  `scale="free_x"` or `scale="free_y"`, the panels share axes
  along the row or column.

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_boxplot`) so that user can create a boxplot
  by specifying all required aesthetics. ({{< issue 136 >}})

- Fixed [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_violin`) to work when some groups are empty.
  ({{< issue 131 >}})

- Fixed continuous scales to accept `minor=None`. ({{< issue 120 >}})

- Fixed bug for discrete position scales, where `drop=False` did not drop
  unused categories. ({{< issue 139 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_ydensity`) that caused an exception
  when a panel had no data. ({{< issue 147 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.coord_trans`) where coordinate
  transformation and facetting could fail with a `KeyError`. ({{< issue 151 >}})

- Fixed bug that lead to a `TypeError` when aesthetic mappings to could be
  recognised as being groupable. It was easy to stumble on this bug when using
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_density`). ({{< issue 165 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_wrap`) where some combination of
  parameters lead to unexpected panel arrangements. ({{< issue 163 >}})

- Fixed bug where the legend text of colorbars could not be themed. ({{< issue 171 >}})

## v0.3.0
*(2017-11-08)*

### API Changes

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_smooth`) gained an extra parameter
  `legend_fill_ratio` that control the area of the legend that is filled
  to indicate confidence intervals. ({{< issue 32 >}})

- [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.save`) gained an extra parameter `verbose`.
  It no longer guesses when to print information and when not to.

- [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.draw`) gained an extra parameter `return_ggplot`.

- If the `minor_breaks` parameter of scales is a callable, it now
  expects one argument, the `limits`. Previously it accepted
  `breaks` and `limits`.

### New Features

- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.animation.PlotnineAnimation`) for animations.
- Added [](:class:`~plotnine.watermark`) for watermarks.
- Added datetime scales for `alpha`, `colour`, `fill` and `size`
  aesthetics

### Enhancements

- Changed parameter settings for [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_smooth`).

  #. Default `span=0.75` instead of `2/3`
  #. When using loess smoothing, the control parameter `surface`
     is only set to the value `'direct'` if predictions will
     be made outside the data range.


- Better control of scale limits. You can now specify individual limits of a scale.

  ```py
  scale_y_continuous(limits=(0, None))
  xlim(None, 100)
  ```

  You can also use [](:func:`~plotnine.expand_limits`)

- Low and high [](:class:`~plotnine.scales.scale.scale`) limits can now be expanded
  separately with different factors multiplicative and additive factors.

- The layer parameter `show_legend` can now accept a `dict` for finer
  grained control of which aesthetics to exclude in the legend.

- Infinite values are removed before statistical computations `stats`.
  ({{< issue 40 >}}).

  `stats` also gained new parameter `na_rm`, that controls whether
  missing values are removed before statistical computations.

- [](:func:`~plotnine.qplot`) can now use the name and a Pandas series to
  label the scales of the aesthetics.

- You can now put stuff to add to a ggplot object into a list and add that
  that instead. No need to wrap the list around the internal class
  `Layers`.

  ```py
  lst = [geom_point(), geom_line()]
  g = ggplot(df, aes('x', 'y'))
  print(g + lst)
  ```

  Using a list allows you to bundle up objects. It can be convenient when
  creating some complicated plots. See the Periodic Table Example.

- You can now use a `dict` (with manual scales) to map data values to
  aesthetics. ({{< issue 169 >}})

- You can now specify infinite coordinates with [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_rect`).
  ({{< issue 166 >}})

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug where facetting led to a reordering of the data. This
  would manifest as a bug for `geoms` where order was important.
  ({{< issue 26 >}})

- Fix bug where facetting by a column whose name (eg. `class`) is
  a python keyword resulted in an exception. ({{< issue 28 >}})

- Fix bug where y-axis scaling was calculated from the `xlim` argument.

- Fix bug where initialising geoms from stats, and positions from geoms,
  when passed as classes (e.g. `stat_smooth(geom=geom_point)`{.py}, would
  fail.

- Fixed bug in [](:meth:`~plotnine.ggplot.save`) where specifying the `width`
  and `height` would mess up the `strip_text` and `spacing` for the
  facetted plots. ({{< issue 44 >}}).

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_abline`),
  [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_hline`) and [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_vline`)
  where facetting on a column that is not mapped to an aesthetic fails.
  ({{< issue 48 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`), the `fontstyle` parameter
  was being ignored.

- Fixed bug where boolean data was mapped to the same value on the coordinate
  axis. ({{< issue 57 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_grid`) where the `scales`
  sometimes has no effect. ({{< issue 58 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_boxplot`) where setting the
  `width` parameter caused an exception.


## v0.2.1
*(2017-06-22)*

- Fixed bug where manually setting the aesthetic `fill=None` or
  `fill="None"` could lead to a black fill instead of an empty
  fill.

- Fixed bug where computed aesthetics could not be used in larger
  statements. ({{< issue 7 >}})

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_summary`) where the you got
  an exception for some types of the `x` aesthetic values.

- Fixed bug where `ggplot(data=df)`{.py} resulted in an exception.

- Fixed missing axis ticks and labels for [](:class:`~plotnine.facet_wrap`)
  when the scales are allowed to vary (e.g `scales="free"`) between
  the panels.

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.stat_density`) where changing the
  x limits lead to an exception. ({{< issue 22 >}})


## v0.2.0
*(2017-05-18)*

- Fixed bug in [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_x_discrete`) and
  [](:class:`~plotnine.scale_y_discrete`) where if they were
  instantiated with parameter `limits` that is either a numpy
  array or a pandas series, plotting would fail with a `ValueError`.

- Fixed exceptions when using [](:func:`pandas.pivot_table`) for Pandas v0.20.0.
  The API was [fixed](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/whatsnew.html#pivot-table-always-returns-a-dataframe).

- Fixed issues where lines/paths with segments that all belonged in the
  same group had joins that in some cases were "butted".


### API Changes

- [](:class:`~plotnine.geom_text`) now uses `ha` and `va` as
  parameter names for the horizontal and vertical alignment. This
  is what matplotlib users expect. The previous names `hjust` and
  `vjust` are silently accepted.

- `plotnine.layer.Layers` can now be used to bundle up `geoms`
  and `stats`. This makes it easy to reuse `geoms` and `stats` or
  organise them in sensible bundles when making complex plots.
